				Used optional chaining (ES6 syntax) to add event listeners to DOM
				elements that weren't displayed on the current page.

				<br />
				Displayed information dynamically using a local JSON data file contained
				to cut down on the amount of html written.
				<br />
				<br /> Made use of object destructuring while fetching data from the
				JSON data file to minimise the creation of redundant variables.
				<br />
				<br /> Figma design files were being used as a guide to laying out the
				website.
				<br />
				<br /> The desktop navigation was implemented in JavaScript to save
				myself the burden of copying/pasting the html on every page created.
				<br />
				<br />
				That way, the menu appears on new pages automatically. The desktop
				navigation was implemented using ES6 classes and private fields

				A simple bank dashboard with transaction history Implementation of the

				transformation array methods like map, filter and reduce.

				<br />
				Utilised the Internationalisation API to format date, time and greetings
				based on the geolocation of the client's browser.
				<br />
				<br />
				This improved accessibility of the web application. Implemented an
				automated log out feature that logged the user out after a set time with
				the setTimeout function (pun intended)

				Vanilla Javascript was used to implement the functionality in this

				<br /> <br /> Made use of Model-view controller architecture to build
				and develop the application.
				<br />
				<br />
				MVC in my own opinion is similar to the architecture React apps use.
				Becasue becasue it require spliting the code into moudules to perform a
				specific task.
				<br />
				<br />
				In other to follow the MVC architecture to the latter, I added using a
				popular design pattern called the Event Publisher subscriber pattern.
				<br />
				<br />
				Used the Event Publisher subscriber pattern to ensure application logic
				happens in the controller.
