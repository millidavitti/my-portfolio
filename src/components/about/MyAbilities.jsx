        <p>
          I use the 3 core technical principles of responsive design; fluid
          grids, fluid images and media queries. I prefer using pure CSS and
          SCSS on demand. Taking the mobile first design approach is my thing,
          not just it being best practice but it making my life easier. When it
          comes to icons I usually opt for SVG&gt;PNG&gt;JPG. Also in process of
          exploring CSS icons to maximize load time.

        <p>
          I use at least three break-points when designing. Usually check your
          visual hierarchy and use progressive disclosure and navigation drawers
          to give users needed items first, keeping nonessential items
          (nice-to-haves) secondary.

          I ensure the use of HTML5â€™s semantic elements It helps structure the
          code I write, making it readable, easier to maintain and makes it
          easier for for search engines to index your website/app. Futhermore,
          HTML5 semantics makes the web accessible to those who live with
          disabilities. Lastly, I use CSS3 to make eye catching presentation of
          the website/app and improve overall user experince.

          Effective collaboration requires a lot from we developers. Therefore,

          open-minded, articulate words and get my message across, am super
          organised (I mean, why won't I? React folder get convoluted real
          quick), incoporate long-term thinking in my work flow, adapt quickly

          React (sometimes called React.js or React JS) is a JavaScript library
          for building fast and interactive user interfaces (UI). I possess this
          super power 'cause it allows me develop complex and scaleable UI's
          with relative ease. This super power is also utilised in mobile app
          development. You see why?

          Git is a version control system system used for tracking changes made

          repository. Allows for coordination/collaboration among teams members
          working on a project and in isolation. It's basically were world store
          code, making it accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
